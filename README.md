# Pi-hole LCARS Next Generation Theme

***

LCARS Theme for [Pi-hole](https://github.com/pi-hole/pi-hole) dashboard. Based on the original theme but heavily customized and refactored.

### 🖖 Theme is now once again **FULLY COMPATIBLE with Pi-hole**!

### ℹ️ This theme replaces the original blue LCARS theme

## Installation
Type the following commands into SSH, line by line.

```
cd /var/www/html/admin/style/themes/
sudo git clone https://github.com/MichalSvatos/pi-hole-lcars-next-gen.git
sudo rm -f lcars.css
sudo cp pi-hole-lcars-next-gen/lcars.css .
sudo rm -rf pi-hole-lcars-next-gen
```

⚠️ Check the trailing " ." on the 3rd line (it's not a typo - it means copy to current directory).

ℹ️ **[v5]** `lcars-v5.css` - older version kept for a better compatibility if someone needs to run Pi-hole v5.

## Uninstall/Revert
Type the following commands into SSH, line by line.

```
cd /var/www/html/admin/style/themes/
sudo git reset --hard
```

## Docker installation
